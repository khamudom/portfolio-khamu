            Collaborated with project managers, the Xbox console design team and
            the engineering team to create and implement UI templates. Worked on
            multiple iterations of the UI from the launch of the Xbox One to the
            console release of the Xbox One S and X.

                      The UI work is done in the Xbox Shell, which is part of
                      the shared partition of the OS. The UI and UX experiences
                      I contributed to within the shell was the home dashboard,
                      stores, and collections, also known as my games and apps.

                    <p>
                      Using the MVVM pattern, the majority of the work was done
                      in the view, using XAML controls. I would build and style
                      the templates, create resource dictionaries and bind the
                      controls to the view model.

                  This structure allowed me to work closely with our engineering
                  partners simultaneously. Often times the design would fall
                  short in the product due to only focusing on making the
                  features work. But with how the files are structured, this
                  gave our engineering team the ability to focus on the
                  functionality of the feature, while I focused on building,
                  crafting and perfecting the UI and UX experiences. Along with
                  making sure the product is accessible.

                  Working from design comps, I would build, style and implement
                  components into parts of the UI on the dashboard and
                  collections.

                  There dashboard grew with more content. Working with our
                  editorial team I created components and layouts they could use
                  to program on the What's On twist. Also built multiple layouts
                  and components for the Store twist

                  Updated the Home layout and rebuilt the recently used tiles.
                  Vertical scrolling was added. The last used content tile was
                  bigger and the other most recently used tiles are below. The
                  reason was to bring in more information of the games or apps
                  that were lasted used.

                  Being more involved with the Editorial team, I helped
                  programmed multiple content types in Compass, which is an
                  internal content publishing tool. The work with editorial was
                  heavily involved in growing the game and app store and
                  supporting the advertisement team. This involved updating and
                  adding components.
